## Description

## Quick start

Scalaboot is a template project to seed new scala repository. 

Dependencies included (September 2014): 

- All basic Scala tools (test, assembly, etc)
- Scalaz
- Scalding

## Quick start

1. If you haven't done so, install **sbt** (https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki)
2. **Clone this project**, giving it a desired output directory: 
	- *git clone git@github.com:ypa-data/scalaboot.git myProjectDir*
- **Sanity test**: run *sbt clean compile stage assembly* This will compile, create a start script for your app, and create assembly for it. If the status of this processs is *success*, we are in business. 
- Open file **project/Project.scala**: 
	- Change the name of **ScalabootBuild** object and **PROJECT_NAME** val to the name of your project.
	- If at this point you know of any dependencies your project needs, add them
- Change the name of the *scalaboot-core* folder to reflect your project name: `scalaboot-core` &rarr; `<your-core>`
- In the source classes, look for the **App**, the application class; it is named `Scalaboot.scala` and it is located in `<your-core>\src\main\scala\sss\scalaboot`. Change this package and the name of the application class.
- **Now it is up to you**: start adding your code and play with it. Make sure, in **project/Project.scala**, to modify the name of your runner (by default it is *HADOOP_JOBRUNNER*).
